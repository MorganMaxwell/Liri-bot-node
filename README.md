# Liri-bot-node

Liri-bot is a Node.js project to simulate 
some of the commands that a phone assistant will
do, like finding concerts or searching Spotify for
a song.

## Installation

Use the Node Package Manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies.

``` bash 
npm i
```

## Usage

Liri-bot takes in specific commands on the terminal or in a .txt file.

**spotify-this-song**
**concert-this**
**movie-this**
**do-what-it-says**

The proper input would be

``` bash
node liri.js **the-command-to-use** **your search**
```
